This is a pure Java networking assignment for my CSC311 class. I was tasked with filling in part of this code to allow messaging between the Host and the Client and use JavaFX for GUI elements. I did this by using raw TCP Java with a set port, and the IP is set as localhost, so this will not work across devices. My code uses input and output between the sockets to update GUI elements every time a message is sent or received.
